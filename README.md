# Silly Sounds - VCV Rack 2 Eurorack Modules

Silly Sounds is a collection of eurorack modules I thought would be neat to make while progressively learning more about audio programming and the VCV Rack developer environment. I'll also be trying to keep things as clearly commented as possible so others can use this as a launching point for their own development.

## Questions/Issues?

Raise a ticket here, check out my [Personal GitHub Pages Site](https://loparcog.github.io/) with notes on each module, or tag me on the [official VCV Rack Discord](https://discord.gg/wxa89Mh) under the user Giacomo!
