# Silly Sounds - VCV Rack 2 Eurorack Modules

Silly Sounds is a collection of eurorack modules I thought would be neat to make while progressively learning more about the VCV Rack developer environment. I'll also be trying to keep things as clearly commented as possible so others can use this as a launching point for their own development.

## Other Module Plans?

Currently, I'm working with a clock-tweaking module to play around with the code without diving headfirst into DSP, but I'm looking to dive into some live samplers and weird meowing modules in the future.

## Questions/Issues?
